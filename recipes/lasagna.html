    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

    <h2>Meat Sauce:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened.</li> 
        <li>Add in the garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon and dried herbs.</li>
        <li>Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each) and sugar if needed.</li> 
        <li>Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Parmesan White Sauce:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for about 30 seconds, or until well blended.</li>
        <li>Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. </li>
        <li>Once well blended, add the remaining milk in 1 cup increments, mixing well after each addition, until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a nice and creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce while stirring occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes) and coats the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is melted through.</li>  
    </ol>
